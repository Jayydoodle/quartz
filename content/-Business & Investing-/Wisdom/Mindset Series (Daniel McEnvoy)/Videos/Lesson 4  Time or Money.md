#### Notes

- <mark style="color:#1DB954; background: #1DB954;">Rich people value time.  Poor people value money</mark>
- A rich man doesn’t mind spending a lot of money to save time, because his time is worth more than the money spent on saving it
- If your time spent working on your businesses/etc. Is equivalent to you making \$500/hr, mowing your own lawn instead of paying someone else \$30 to mow it for you for an hour actually makes you LOSE \$470 
- A millionaire is not afraid of spending money, he’s afraid of spending time
- You won’t get rich by putting money on a pedestal and spending your time to save it
- The best way to make decisions is not based on your current circumstances, but where you want to be a year from now
- <mark style="color:#F57D0D; background: #F57D0D;">If you’re not spending your money, then you’re spending your life</mark>
