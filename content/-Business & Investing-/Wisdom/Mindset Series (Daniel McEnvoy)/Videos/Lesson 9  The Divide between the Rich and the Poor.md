#### Notes

- The programming instilled by society is just a reflection of the most common beliefs of that time period
- If you’ve been influenced by society and the average person in society is not rich, <mark style="color:#F6909D; background: #F6909D;">you have been programmed to not be rich</mark>
- If the people around you are poor, normal, and boring - you will grow up to be poor, normal, and boring.  This is why the rich get richer.  The rich impart the knowledge of getting rich on their children
- The way you eat, live, think and feel has all been programmed inside of you to keep you where you are
