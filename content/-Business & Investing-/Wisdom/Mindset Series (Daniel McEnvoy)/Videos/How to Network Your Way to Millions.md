#### Notes

- <mark style="color:#47B7DC; background: #47B7DC;">One of the biggest things holding you back is hanging around with people with a net worth less than 6 figures</mark>
- Why is networking (knowing rich people) important?
	- Opportunities are most often given on a proximity basis, not a skill basis
	- Its not what you know, its WHO you know
	- With the right guidance, you can learn 98% of necessary knowledge/skills fast if you don’t already possess it
- How to network outside of the College -> 9.5 world?
	- Masterminds Groups - the closest proximity you can get to the person who is teaching the skills he possesses.  Become the #1 student for endless opportunities
	- Private Networks/Communities - Any community with strict requirements for entry is amazing for networking for numerous reasons
		- Openness to conversations - People join networks to avoid talking to the type of people who wouldn't be inside the network
		- Filtered for greatness - The ratio of low value: high value people you’ll talk to is weighed in your favor massively
		- Assumed success - Simply by being in this group, every first impression of you will be of one of success.  Use this as your edge
	- Give time/money
	- Conferences/Networking Events - Approach and talk to everyone, build good first impressions, then incorporate steps 1-3
- Engineering Luck - create situations where luck can occur, which can present you with opportunities that can transform your life
