#### Notes

- The chances of getting rich are already slim.  Why make it harder by relying only on a low probability path to get rich?
- Don’t chase trading/investing when you’re broke.  Focus on building income through a business/high paying job.  
- You should be making at least 10k/month before trying to invest
- Invest income back into your network, mentors, education, business.  This is the best path because skills are a lifetime asset.  The power to profit is in YOUR control, not the markets
- The bull market in yourself begins as soon as you want it to.  WAIT FOR NO ONE.
