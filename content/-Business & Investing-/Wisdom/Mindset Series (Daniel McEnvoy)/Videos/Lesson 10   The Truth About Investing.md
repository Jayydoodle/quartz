#### Notes

- The number 1 error people make around ‘investing’ is that they base their perception around investing from their limiting beliefs
- ‘Building a business is hard’ and you’re not smart enough, young enough, wealthy enough, etc.
- You don’t appreciate the game of making wealth, and only view it as a means to an end.  “I need to get rich so I don’t have to work”
- You don’t believe that the ROI on investing in yourself is higher than investing in stocks/crypto
- Before making 6 figures a year and having 50k+ to invest, focus on building your skills, network, and income
