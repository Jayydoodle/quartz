#### Notes

- 80% of how you feel is determined by your environment
- If you aren’t able to curate your physical environment, you should curate your online one
- Make a list of every app/website you use
	- Determine if each app is a net positive or net negative on your life
	- If its a net negative, remove it
- If you need time to waste, always scroll through Twitter (or something else that is at least somewhat productive).  But <mark style="color:#1DB954; background: #1DB954;">consumption does not replace action</mark>
