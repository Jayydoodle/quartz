#### Notes

- If you aren’t in decent shape, $ is the LAST thing you should be worried about
- If you’re not physically fit, you have:
	- Decreased energy
	- Decreased motivation
	- Can’t focus on key tasks for long
	- More limiting beliefs to overcome
- <mark style="color:#47B7DC; background: #47B7DC;">Prove to yourself that you can be healthy and have a healthy mindset before trying to get rich</mark>
- Wealth amplifies who you are BEFORE you got rich.  Do you want to be a fat disgusting millionaire, or the G who built himself WHILE getting rich?
