#### Notes

- The optimal timeframe to make a decision is <mark style="color: #ED2939; background: #ED2939;">30 minutes to an hour</mark>
- You should be able to make ANY decision in your life within 1 hour if you completely remove all other distractions and focus only on the decision
- The chance of a decision being correct past the 1 hour mark is only <mark style="color:#47B7DC; background: #47B7DC;">marginally better</mark>, and generally not worth the time loss.Â  The speed of your decision making is important because you will need to make at least 10,000 of them before becoming a millionaire
- <mark style="color:#FBF719 ; background: #FBF719 ;">You overestimate your ability to view a decision from a new perspective by delaying</mark>
