#### Notes

- <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">Men are built to conquer</mark>.  Your life will never be better than when you’re winning, or becoming a winner.  <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">It is your biological purpose</mark>
- By the definition of ‘retirement’ you are saying that you no longer wish to advance, continue, or increase
- If you desire retirement, you are out of touch with your true masculine energy
- <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">‘Preparing for retirement’ is the poor man’s justification for a lifetime of slavery</mark>
- You should aim to get to a place where you have achieved such a level of advancement that you don’t need to care about limiting beliefs such as needing to save for retirement, emergency funds, mortgages, etc.
- <mark style="color:#47B7DC; background: #47B7DC;">Why do you need to plan for retirement if in 2-5 years you’ll be a millionaire?</mark>
- Life is conquest all the way to the end.  You don’t need to worry about ‘retirement’ if you view life through this lens
