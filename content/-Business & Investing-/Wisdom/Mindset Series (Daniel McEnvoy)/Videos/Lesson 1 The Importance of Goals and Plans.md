#### Notes

- <mark style="color:#FBF719 ; background: #FBF719 ;">99% of people deserve to be where they are right now (poor)</mark>
- 95% of people are really bad at making plans which actually achieve their goals
- Most people have no clue why stocks, real estate, and cash are terrible investments
	- ‘I want to make $1 million dollars by 2024’ translates to ‘I want to be rich ASAP’
	- ‘Stocks, real estate, passive income’ as your goal translates to ‘I want to be rich by retirement’
- 99% of people have total misalignment between their goals and plans
- You need to be willing to spend money to level up the people around you.  You are the average of the 5 people you’re around
