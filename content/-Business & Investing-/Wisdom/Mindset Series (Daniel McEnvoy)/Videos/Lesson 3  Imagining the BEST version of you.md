#### Notes

- If you can imagine a version of yourself that is already rich by your age, <mark style="color:#FBF719 ; background: #FBF719 ;">you are the inferior version of yourself</mark>
- The best version of you <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">always does everything that he knows he needs to do</mark>
- The best version of you <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">doesn’t hesitate</mark>
- The best version of you <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">makes quick decisions</mark>
- The best version of you <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">doesn’t act from fear</mark>
- The best version of you <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">doesn’t have limiting beliefs</mark>
- The best version of you <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">is always endlessly motivated</mark>
- On a scale of 1-10, how much of this man is you currently?  If he was placed in your body today, what actions would he take to change?
- The framework for living your life should be to always do what the best version of you would be doing
