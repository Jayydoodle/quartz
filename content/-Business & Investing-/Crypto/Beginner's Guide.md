## Where to buy Crypto

The process for turning your fiat currency (USD or whatever other currency) into Crypto involves signing up for one of the many cryptocurrency exchanges that allow you to onboard funds from your bank account.  Some of the most popular ones are:

- **Coinbase**
The simplest place to buy Crypto, but it does take quite a while for account verification, and fees can be high.  They are the leading US cryptocurrency exchange all will likely be the custodian for the upcoming BlackRock ETF.  FDIC Insured up to 250k.

- **Crypto.com**
Another US based crypto exchange, you might recognize the name as the home stadium of the Los Angeles Lakers (Crypto.com Arena).  Has it’s own debit card which allows you to spend your Cryptocurrency.

- **Binance**
Binance is the largest Crypto exchange.  However it us currently unavailable for US customers

## Where To Store Crypto

There are two ways to store Cryptocurrency:

1. In a digital wallet that <mark style="color:#1DB954; background: #1DB954;">YOU own</mark>
2. In an exchange wallet that <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">you DON’T own</mark>

To GET Crypto, use a centralized exchange and turn your cash into Crypto.

To HOLD Crypto, withdraw the cryptocurrency from the centralized exchange to your own digital wallet.

The reason exchange wallets is highlighted in red, is because you should generally store your crypto in your own wallet.

There is a saying in Crypto **‘<mark style="color:#FBF719 ; background: #FBF719 ;">Not your keys, not your coins</mark>’.**

This saying basically means if you don’t own the key to access your wallet, you don’t really own your coins, because if the exchange gets hacked or disappears suddenly for whatever reason, your money is gone!

Hacks aren't really a thing for the larger regulated exchanges like Coinbase, etc., and most US based exchanges are FDIC insured up to 250k.  But its still best practice to take **self custody** of your coins once you're comfortable.  That's the reason Bitcoin was created in the first place!

I recommend using a **LONG** and **RANDOM** password for your wallets.  This is best achieved with a password manager.  I personally use [1Password](https://1password.com/)

For even more security, you can consider investing in a **hardware wallet**.  This is actually the safest possible way to store your crypto.  The benefits of a hardware wallet include:

- Its not connected to the internet
- Requires the USB device for any transaction to be sent
- Wallet access is physical, meaning you can take it with you

The most well-known wallet is the **Ledger Nano X**.  You can read more about hardware wallets on their website [here](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-hardware-wallet)

## What Crypto Should I Buy First?

Before diving into the more complex areas of crypto, you should first get comfortable with buying **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Stablecoins** on a **centralized exchange** like Coinbase and transferring them in and out of your wallets.  These are the least volatile cryptos you can buy and carry the least amount of risk.

---
## What Are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is [pegged](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp), or tied, to that of another currency or real-world asset. 

For example, the tokens [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) and [USDT](https://tether.to/en/) are both stablecoins that are pegged to the US dollar.  They are both worth $1 and are both backed by treasuries (which are regularly audited) to ensure the peg remains equal to a real dollar.

These stablecoins allow you a way to onboard your fiat (real money) into the crypto ecosystem without needing to immediately purchase a volatile asset like Bitcoin, and also give you the flexibility to cash out any profits you make while trading crypto without needing to completely move the funds back to your bank account.

The basic crypto trading workflow is:
Buy stablecoin -> buy Bitcoin (or some other crypto) -> Bitcoin goes up -> sell Bitcoin for stablecoin -> wait for Bitcoin to go down -> repeat from step 2

## What Is A Decentralized Exchange?

The exchanges mentioned earlier in this guide (Coinbase, Binance, etc.) are examples of **centralized exchanges**

A centralized exchange (CEX) is company which provides you a platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies.  They store cryptocurrency for you and own the private key to the wallets you use for trading.  They usually require platform users to undergo a [Know Your Customer (KYC)](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it) process to comply with any government regulations put in place to verify user identities and reduce illegal activities.

Advantages
- Simple to use vs. decentralized exchanges
- Most allow you to onboard money from your bank account
- Coins trading on these exchanges have generally been vetted and won't be scams
- There's access to more [[Liquidity]] which makes buying/selling easier
- Generally have to adhere to government regulations

Disadvantages
- <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">They own your private key</mark>
- Have to deal with government regulations
- Target for hacks and exploits (though not common for major exchanges)
- No access to newer crypto projects that have the greatest risk/reward potential

A **decentralized exchange** (or [[DEX]]) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders.  DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary.

Advantages
- No KYC requirements, your trades are anonymous
- Access to any new coin, often within seconds of it being created
- Lower transaction fees compared to CEXs
- The coins are going directly from someone else's wallet to your own, so less susceptible to hacks that affect the user

Disadvantages
- Riskier coins - around 90% of DEX coins can be scams like a [[Rugged]] or a [[Honeypot]]
- More technical than CEX crypto trading
- Potential irreversible losses from user error
- No customer support
- Potential for [[Sandwich Attacks]]

## Is Crypto A Scam?

![[meme_is_crypto_a_scam.png|700]]

The truth of Crypto is 99% of the projects that exist are scams.

Bitcoin, Etherum and a few other projects are about the only projects I can genuinely say are not scams.

Just because something is a ‘scam’ doesn’t mean you can’t make money from it, and isn’t worth investing in.

Some scams are worse then others, and some scams provide value and create adoption in Crypto.

But at the end of the day, the founders behind 99% of projects are just trying to get rich from you.

This may sound like a harsh truth, but it is the best way to think about Crypto, because if you think it is all sunshine and rainbows, you will get [[Rekt]].

## Is Crypto A Ponzi Scheme?

![[meme_is_crypto_a_ponzi.png|800]]

The truth is everything that involves money and making a profit is basically a ponzi scheme.

Retirement Funds, Stocks, Crypto, everything requires more people to buy the thing you own for you to sell it at a profit.

I don’t want to go deep at all down this rabbit hole in the beginner guide, so we will simply leave the explanation there.

Crypto is a ponzi scheme, but so is everything, so the question is not ‘<mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">Should I invest in a ponzi scheme?</mark>’ it’s ‘<mark style="color:#1DB954; background: #1DB954;">Which ponzi scheme do I want to invest in?</mark>'
