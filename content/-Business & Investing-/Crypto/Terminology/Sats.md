Sats is short for Satoshis, the smallest unit of [[Bitcoin]] (BTC), named after the elusive creator of the coin, [[Satoshi Nakamoto]]. 

Just like fiat currency, cryptocurrencies can also be divided into smaller units. As such, itâ€™s helpful to think of Sats as you would cents to a dollar. Whereas 1 dollar equals 100 cents, 1 Bitcoin equals 100 million Satoshis.
