Also known as 'Alts' - are any cryptocurrency that is an alternative to Bitcoin.  

[[Ethereum]] is the most widely recognized Altcoin.

Altcoins are normally created to solve or improve some type of limitation inherent to Bitcoin, or satisfy some niche use case.  Thus, many different types of altcoins have been created over the years to satisfy different needs.  Some of these different coin types include:

[[Utility Tokens]]
Used to provide services within a network. For example, they might be used to purchase services, pay network fees, or redeem rewards.  This type of token ends up having tons of sub-categories that satisfy different use cases in the blockchain world - tokens used for AI, gambling, gaming, telecoms.  Pretty much any real-life problem you can think of, someone has attempted to make a blockchain version of it.

[[Governance Tokens]]
Governance tokens allow holders certain rights within a blockchain, such as voting for changes to protocols or having a say in decisions of a [[DAO]] aka DAO

[[Meme Coins]]
Inspired by a real-world joke or a silly take on other well-known cryptocurrencies.  These coins normally have little to no
intrinsic value / use case and go up just from popularity alone
