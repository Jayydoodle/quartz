A honeypot typically involves setting a token’s sell tax to a very high percentage in the smart contract code

There are typically two common scenarios you will see:

1. A scammer will create and launch a shiny new token with a low (or no) buy tax, but the sell tax is set to a high percent (100% for example). What happens is you buy the token and then when you go to sell, all of your money goes to the team as it has a 100% sell tax. <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">You get nothing</mark>.
      
2. The second scenario is the same as the first, however, the team will delay setting the sell tax to 100% until a later time. This allows the chart to look “normal” as people are buying and selling which then pulls more investors into the honeypot. Once the token has enough buyers, the team sets the sell tax to 100% and again, <mark style="color:#ED2939; background: #ED2939;">you get nothing</mark>.
