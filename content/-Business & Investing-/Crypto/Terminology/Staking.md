When you stake coins, you are effectively locking them away in a digital wallet for the purpose of supporting the network. You are rewarded with more coins/tokens while your wallet is staking, so its essentially a form of passive income.

However, while staking the coins you generally cannot trade them - and some often have lengthy [[unbonding]] periods that a user must wait until they can retrieve their staked tokens
