DEX is an acronym for decentralized exchange. Unlike centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges aren’t governed by a central authority, have no intermediary, and trading is done in a non-custodial way.  It is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders.  DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary.

Advantages
- No KYC requirements, your trades are anonymous
- Access to any new coin, often within seconds of it being created
- Lower transaction fees compared to [[CEX]]s
- The coins are going directly from someone else's wallet to your own, so less susceptible to hacks that affect the user

Disadvantages
- Riskier coins - around 90% of DEX coins can be scams like a [[Rugged]] or a [[Honeypot]]
- More technical than CEX crypto trading
- Potential irreversible losses from user error
- No customer support
- Potential for [[Sandwich Attacks]]
