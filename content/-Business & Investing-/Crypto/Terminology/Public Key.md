A cryptographic key that allows a user to receive cryptocurrency from another user, but cannot be used to send funds.  Anyone can deposit cryptocurrency in a public address, but funds cannot be removed from an address without the corresponding [[private key]].

Your public key is generally safe to give out to others.
