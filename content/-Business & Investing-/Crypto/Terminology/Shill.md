A shill is someone who shamelessly promotes a project, token, or coin while trying to appear objective, but actually benefits from it becoming more popular (for example, because they they own the token and want the price to rise so they can dump their holdings on you).

Shilling refers to the act of promoting in an attempt to get others to buy the project.
