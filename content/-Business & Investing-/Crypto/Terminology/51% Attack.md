A 51% attack is an attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by a group who controls more than 50% of the network's miningÂ [[Hash Rate]]. Owning 51% of the nodes on the network theoretically gives the controlling parties the power to alter the blockchain.

This would allow them to do things like halt payments between some or all users, reverse transactions, and [[Double Spend]] coins
