# Major Reversal Patterns


#### Two Types Of Patterns: Continuation and Reversal

- Reversal patterns indicate that an important reversal in trend is taking place
- Continuation patterns suggest the market is only pausing for awhile, and the major trend will continue
- Volume plays an important role in confirming price patterns.  In times of doubt, the volume can be the deciding factor

> [!TIP] Things common to all reversal patterns
> 1. A prerequisite for any reversal pattern is the existence of a prior trend. 
> 2. The first signal of an impending trend reversal is often the breaking of an important trendline. 
> 3. The larger the pattern, the greater the subsequent move. 
> 4. Topping patterns are usually shorter in duration and more volatile than bottoms. 
> 5. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges and take longer to build. 
> 6. Volume is usually more important on the upside.

#### The Head And Shoulders Pattern

- The best known and most reliable of all major reversal patterns.  This occurs when a trend reaches a top, and then trends down - with the resulting chart resembling a head at the top, and two peaks resembling shoulders on the upside and downside  <br><br>
- At the point of the left shoulder, the uptrend is proceeding and volume is expanding as expected.  The corrective dip is on lighter volume, as expected, but the volume at the top to the upside was lighter than it was at the left shoulder.  Another pullback occurs and  the decline goes lower than the left shoulder point - all the way down to the previous low.  The market then rallies again to a point at or close to the left shoulder on lighter volume, but doesn’t overtake that point - forming the right shoulder

- Once a head and shoulders pattern has been identified, a flatter trendline can be drawn under the last 2 reaction lows, called the neckline.  The deciding factor in the resolution of the head and shoulders pattern is a decisive closing violation of the neckline <br><br> 
  
- A return move is a bounce back to the bottom of the neckline, or to a previous reaction low point (both of which have now become overhead resistance).  If the initial breaking of the neckline is on very heavy trading, the odds for a return move are diminished because the increased activity reflects greater downside pressure.  Lighter volume on the initial break increases the likelihood of a return move.  That bounce should be on lighter volume though, and the resumption of the downtrend should be accompanied by heavier volume
  
> [!TIP] A head and shoulders top requires:
> 
>- A prior uptrend
>- A left shoulder on heavier volume, followed by a corrective dip
>- A rally into new highs, but on lighter volume
>- A decline that moves below the previous peak, and approaches a previous reaction low
>- A third rally point on noticeably light volume that fails to reach the top of the head
>- A close below the neckline
>- A return move back to the neckline, followed by new lows

#### The Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern

- Also known as the head and shoulders bottom, this is basically a mirror image of the original pattern at the bottom.  The only significant difference is the volume in the 2nd half of the pattern
- The volume in the first half is the same in that the volume at the head is lighter.  The rally shows itself in increased trading activity in the right shoulder, with a sharp burst through the neckline
- At a top, markets can fall just from inertia.  But at a bottom, markets require a significant increase in buying pressure to launch a new bull market

#### Complex Head And Shoulders Patterns

- These are patterns where two heads may appear, or a double left and right shoulder
- These are not as common, but have implications for forecasting - for example, they tend to be symmetric.  A single left shoulder normally indicates a single right shoulder.  A double left shoulder indicates a double right shoulder, etc.

##### The Failed Head And Shoulders Pattern

- Once prices have moved through the neckline and completed the head and shoulders pattern, ***prices should not recross the neckline again***.
- At a top, once the neckline has been broken on the downside, any decisive close back above the neckline is a serious warning that the initial breakdown was a bad signal
- This pattern starts out looking like a head and shoulders, but at some point (either prior to breaking of the neckline or just after it), prices resume their original trend
- The head and shoulders pattern can also act as a consolidation pattern rather than a reversal pattern

#### Triple Tops and Bottoms

- A triple top or bottom is a variation of the head and shoulders pattern.  The main difference is the three peaks or troughs are at about the same level instead of resembling shoulders (pg. 116)
- The volume tends to decline with each successive peak at the top and increases at the breakdown point
- A triple top is not complete until support levels along both of the intervening lows have been broken.  Conversely, prices must close through the two intervening peaks at the bottom to complete a triple bottom

#### Double Tops And Bottoms

- Much more common than a triple top, and the most frequently seen and easily recognized (pg. 118)
- General characteristics for volume/measurement are the same as head and shoulders and triple tops
- The terms ‘double top and bottom’ are greatly overused in financial markets and often end up being something else.  This is because prices have a strong tendency to back off from a previous peak or bounce off a previous low, and do not always indicate a reversal pattern.  Remember that at a top, prices must actually violate the previous reaction low before the double top exists (pg. 124)
- The longer the time period between the two peaks and the greater the height of the pattern, the greater potential impending reversal.  This is true of all chart patterns

#### Saucer Bottoms And Spikes  

- A saucer bottom shows a very slow and very gradual turn from down to sideways to up.  They are usually spotted on weekly or monthly charts that span several years (pg. 126)

- Spikes (or V patterns) are turns that happen very quickly with little to no transition period.  They usually take place in a market that has gotten so overextended in one direction, or because of a sudden piece of adverse news.  A daily or weekly reversal on heavy volume is sometimes the only warning sign given
