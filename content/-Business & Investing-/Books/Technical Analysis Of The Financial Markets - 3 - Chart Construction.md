# Chart Construction

- On a daily bar chart, the tick to the left of the bar is the opening price.  The tick to the left is the closing price <br><br>
- Candlestick charts express the open, close, low, and high on a chart.  The open and close are the top and bottom of the large bar.  The top and bottom candle wicks represent the high and low prices during that time frame <br><br>
- [[Volume]] represents the total trading activity in the market for that day - the total number of futures contracts traded that day or the total number of common stock shares that change hands on a given day <br><br>
- [[Open Interest]] is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that are held by market participants at the end of the day.  It is the number of outstanding contracts held by the longs or shorts, not the total of both.  For futures contracts - for every long there must also be a short, so we only need to know the totals for one side <br><br>
- Futures typically only use the total volume and open interest figures.  In the early stages of a future’s contract’s life, volume and open interest are usually quite small.  The figures build as the contract reaches maturity, but start to drop in the last couple months before expiration.  This is because traders need to liquidate as the contract approaches expiration <br><br>
- Futures volume and open interest numbers are reported a day late.  Estimates are available after the market closes.  Volume totals for stocks  on the other hand, are immediately available <br><br>
- The individual open interest numbers in futures tell us which contracts are the most liquid for trading purposes.  As a general rule, <span style="background:#fff88f"><font color="#000000">trading activity should be limited to months with the highest open interest</font></span>.  Months with low open interest should be avoided <br><br>
- The intraday bar chart measures the high, low, and last prices for periods as short as five minutes.  The average daily bar chart covers from 6 to 9 months of price action.  For longer range analysis, weekly and monthly bar charts must be used
