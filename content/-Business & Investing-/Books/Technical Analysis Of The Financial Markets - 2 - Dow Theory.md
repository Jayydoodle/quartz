# Dow Theory

#### The Averages Discount Everything

- This is the idea that the markets reflect every possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and demand.  Everything is already ‘priced in’
- This idea even makes allowances for ‘Acts of God’.  Although markets cannot predict these events, they almost instantaneously assimilate their effects into [[price action]]

#### The Market Has Three Trends

[[Uptrend]] ![[Uptrend]][[Downtrend]] ![[Downtrend]]
- The three parts of a trend are **primary**, **secondary**, and **minor** which are comparable to the tide, waves and ripples of the sea
- Market tides (primary) last at least a year and can last several years.  The waves (secondary) usually last 3 weeks to 3 months - these generally retrace between ⅓ and ⅔ of the previous trend movement and most frequently about half of the previous move.  The ripples (minor) usually last less than 3 weeks.  This period represents fluctuations in the intermediate trend

#### Major Trends Have Three Phases

- The three phases of major trends are [[accumulation]], public participation, and distribution
- The accumulation phase represents informed buying by the most astute investors
- The public participation phase occurs when prices begin to advance rapidly and business news improves (this is where most technical trend-followers begin to participate)
- The distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print increasingly bullish stories, when economic news is better than ever, and when speculative volume and public participation increase.  During this phase, the ‘astute investors’ from the accumulation phase are the first to sell

#### The Averages Must Confirm Each Other

- No important bear or bull market signal can take place unless both averages give the same signal, confirming each other
- The signals don’t need to occur simultaneously, but a shorter length of time between the two signals provides stronger confirmation
- When the averages diverge, assume that the prior trend is still maintained (Elliott wave theory only requires signals to be generated in a single average)

#### Volume Must Confirm Trend

- [[Volume]] should expand or increase in the direction of a major trend
- In a major uptrend, volume would increase as prices move higher and diminish as prices fall
- In a downtrend, the volume should increase as prices drop and diminish as they rally
- In today’s market, volume indicators can help determine if volume is increasing or falling.  This can be compared to price action to see if they confirm each other

#### A Trend Is Assumed To Be In Effect Until It Gives Definite Signals That It Has Reversed

- An object in motion tends to continue until an external force changes its direction
- [[Support]] and [[Resistance]] levels, price patterns, [[trendlines]], and [[moving averages]] can be used to assist in spotting [[reversals]]
- [[Failure Swing]] - The failure of a peak to overcome (go higher than) the previous peak on a chart
- [[Nonfailure Swing]] - When a peak overcomes the previous peak, but prints a lower low during the next peak

The failure swing is a much weaker pattern than a nonfailure swing **(pg. 30-31)**
