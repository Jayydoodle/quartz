# Philosophy of Technical Analysis

[[Technical Analysis]]
![[Technical Analysis]]
[[Price Action]]
![[Price Action]]
- There are three premises on which the technical approach is based:
	1. Price action discounts everything
	2. Prices move in [[trend|trends]]
	3. History repeats itself
	
- #1 forms the cornerstone of technical analysis.  If demand exceeds supply, prices rise.  If supply exceeds demand, prices fall

- TA believes that everything that can possibly affect the price - fundamentally, politically, or psychologically - is already reflected in the price of the market.  Thus, the study or price action alone is sufficient

- TA is based on the theory that markets move in [[trend|trends]].  A trend in motion is more likely to continue that to reverse, like [[Newton's 1st Law of Motion]]

- Fundamental Analysis is the opposite of TA, and focuses more on the economic forces of supply and demand that cause prices to move or stay the same
	- Examines all relevant factors to determine [[intrinsic value]]
	- Intrinsic value is what the fundamentals indicate something is worth based on supply + demand
	- If market price is below intrinsic value, then the market is undervalued

<span style="background:#b1ffff">At the beginning of important market moves, fundamental analysis does not explain or support what the market is doing</span>

- Market prices leads the known fundamentals, or the conventional wisdom of the moment.  When prices move, price is reacting to the unknown fundamentals

- The most dramatic bull and bear markets in history have begun with little to no change in fundamentals (Gamestop, AMC, Doge, etc.)
