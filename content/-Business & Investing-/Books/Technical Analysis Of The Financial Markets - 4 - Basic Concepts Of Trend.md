# Basic Concepts Of Trend

#### Definition of Trend

- The purpose of TA is to measure the trend of the market for the purpose of participating in that trend.  The trend is simply the direction of the market, the overall direction of the peaks and troughs
- An uptrend is successively higher peaks and troughs, a downtrend is declining peaks and troughs, and horizontal peaks and troughs is a sideways trend
- Technical tools often work very poorly when markets are ‘trendless’ or [[Trading Sideways]]
- There are 3 decisions a trader must make, whether to buy a market ([[Long Trade]]), sell a market (go [[Short Trade]]), or do nothing.  

<span style="background:#b1ffff">**When a market is sideways it is generally wisest to do nothing**</span>

#### Trend Classification

- A trend is usually broken up into 3 categories - major, intermediate, and near term.  
- Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend, and itself is comprised of smaller trends.  For example, the immediate trend would be a correction in the major trend
- As a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months

#### Support and Resistance

- In a trend, the troughs (aka reaction lows) are known as [[support]].  This is a level on the chart where buying interest is sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure.  Usually a support level is identified beforehand by a previous reaction low
- [[Resistance]] is the opposite of support - the area where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure.  This is usually identified beforehand by a previous peak

<span style="background:#b1ffff">**For an uptrend to continue, each successive low must be higher than the one preceding it.  Each rally high must be higher than the one before it.  If the corrective dip in an uptrend comes all the way down to the previous low, it may be an early warning that the uptrend is ending (or moving to a sideways trend).**</span>

- Whenever a support or resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their roles and become the opposite - in other words, resistance becomes a support level and support becomes resistance
- [[The psychology of support and resistance]]
- Determining the significance of support areas
	- The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes
	- If a support area is formed on heavy volume, this indicates that a large number of units changed hands - which marks the support level as more important
	- The more recent the trading activity occurred which formed the support level, the more potent it becomes

 A support level, penetrated by a significant margin, becomes a resistance level (and vice versa)

Round numbers (10, 25, 50, 100, 1000, etc.) play as “psychological” support and resistance levels as traders tend to think in terms of these numbers when making decisions.  <span style="background:#b1ffff">**Avoid placing orders right at obvious round numbers**</span>

#### Trendlines

- An up trendline is a straight line drawn upward to the right along successive reaction lows 

![[up_trendline.png]]

- A down trendline is drawn downward to the right along successive rally peaks

![[down_trendline.png]]

- For a trendline to be drawn, there must be evidence of a trend.  For an up trendline, there must be at least two reaction lows with the second low higher than the first (need to points to draw a straight line) **(pg. 66-67)**
- Some chartists require that the peak at point 2 be penetrated to confirm the uptrend before drawing the trendline
- Others only require a 50% retracement of wave 2-3, or that prices approach the top of wave 2
- A trendline with only 2 points is a tentative trendline.  In order to confirm the trend, the line should be touched a third time with prices bouncing off of it
- Once the third point is confirmed and the trend proceeds in its original direction, it will usually maintain the same slope.  This can help determine the extremity of corrective phases, and tell us when the trend is changing.  
- In an uptrend, the corrective dip will usually touch or come very close to the up trendline.  This provides a potential buying area.  In a downtrend, the trendline is used as resistance for selling purposes

<span style="background:#b1ffff">**The breaking of a trendline is one of the best early warnings of a change in trend**</span>

- A trendline is more significant the longer it stays in tact and the number of times it has been tested
- If a trendline has been broken during the day, but still closes above the trend - you must make the decision on whether or not the trend has been violated.  Sometimes it can be best to ignore a minor breach - others you may need to redraw the trendline
- As a general rule, a close beyond the trendline is more significant than an intraday penetration.  This is not always enough though, and time and price filters can be used to eliminate [[whipsaws]] - or bad signals.
- One example of a price filter is the 3% penetration criteria, which requires that a trendline is broken at closing by 3% to be considered penetrated
- An example of a time filter is the two day rule.  This filter says that prices must close beyond the trendline for two successive days

Trendlines reverse roles the same way support and resistance do (up trendline becomes resistance once broken, down trendline becomes support once broken).  This is why its a good idea to draw trendlines as far out to the right as possible **(pg. 72-73)**

#### The Fan Principle 

- After a trendline is violated, prices typically rally back to the bottom of the old up trendline.  If that line fails to be penetrated, a second trendline can be drawn at the resistance point, and if it fails to rally again, a 3rd trendline can be drawn at the bottom.  Once this 3rd trendline has been broken, it is a good signal of a trend reversal **pg. 74-75**

#### The Importance Of The Number Three

- In technical analysis things tend to come in 3s - the fan principle uses 3 lines, markets have 3 major phases (dow/elliot wave theory), there are 3 types of gaps, common reversal patterns like head and shoulders and triple top have 3 major peak, etc. **pg. 76**

#### Relative Steepness Of A Trendline

- Most valid trendlines rise at an angle approximating 45 degrees.  If the line is too steep, it usually indicates that the rate of ascent is unsustainable.  If it is too flat, it suggests the uptrend is too weak and probably suspect
- As trendlines accelerate or decelerate (get steeper or flatter), other trendlines should be drawn that more accurately represent the current price action **pg. 77-78, 80**
- In an accelerating trend, where steeper trendlines are necessary - it is often better to use [[moving averages]]

#### The Channel Line

- The **channel line**, or **return line** is a variation of the [[trendlines|trendline]] where a 2nd line is drawn parallel to the basic trendline at the first prominent peak (or bottom in a downtrend), forming a channel between the low and high points of a trend
- If the next rally reaches, but does not overtake the channel line then a channel may exist.  If prices drop back to the trendline then a channel probably does exist
- The channel is useful as it can be used to determine areas for short term profit taking
- The breaking of a channel line has the opposite meaning of breaking a trendline - it signals that the current trend will accelerate
- Failures to reach a channel line are usually a sign of a weakening trend, and an early warning sign that the basic trendline may soon be broken

<span style="background:#b1ffff">Channel lines often have implications for reversal measurement.  Once a breakout occurs from an existing price channel, prices usually travel a distance equal to the channel</span>

#### Percentage Retracements

- After a particular market move, prices tend to retrace a portion of the previous trend before resuming the move in the original direction - which often fall into predictable percentage parameters
- One common phenomenon is the **50% retracement**, which means the trend will retrace about half of its previous move before momentum is regained
- Retracements typically fall into a minimum of ⅓ (33%) and ⅔ (66%).  This means that in the correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third of the previous move.  This is useful information if a trader is looking for a buy area, as they can compute a 33-50% zone on the chart and use that as a frame of reference
- The maximum retracement of 66% is a critical area, because for a trend to continue the correction must stop at the ⅔ point.  If prices move beyond the ⅔ point, then odds favor a trend reversal

#### Speed Resistance Levels

- Speedlines combine trendlines with percentage retracements to measure the rate of ascent of descent of a trendline.
- To construct a bullish speedline, find the highest point on the current uptrend.  From that point, draw a vertical line toward the bottom of the chart to where the trend began.  The line is then divided into thirds, and a trendline is drawn from the beginning of the trend to the point at each ⅓ point.  These lines should act as support/resistance during corrections/bounces (pg. 88-89)
![[speedlines.png]]
- Each time a new high or new low is set, the speedline must be redrawn
- As with all trendlines, speedlines reverse roles once they are broken

#### Reversal Days

- A reversal day takes place either at a top or a bottom.  A *top reversal day* would be the setting of a new high in a trend, followed by a lower close (lower than the previous day’s close) on the same day
- The wider the range for the day and the heavier the volume, the more significant the signal is for a possible near term trend reversal
- This pattern can also show up on weekly and monthly charts, which are increasingly more significant

#### Price Gaps

- Price gaps are areas on a chart where no trading has taken place
- Upside gaps are signs of market strength, while downside gaps are usually signs of weakness
- Gaps that appear on long term weekly and monthly charts are usually very significant
- **Breakaway Gap** - Unusually occurs at the completion of an important price pattern, and usually signals the beginning of a significant market move.  
	- Major breakouts from topping or basing areas are breeding grounds for this type
	- The breaking of a trendline can also produce a breakaway gap
	- They usually occur on heavy volume
	- Most of the time they are not filled - the higher the volume, the less likely it will be filled
	- Upside gaps usually act as support areas on market corrections
	- Its important prices don’t fall below gaps during an uptrend
- **Runaway Gap** - After a move has been underway, prices will leap forward and form this type of gap.  It reveals a situation where the market is moving effortlessly on moderate volume
	- In an uptrend, this is a sign of market strength.  In a downtrend, its weakness
	- They act as support under market corrections and are often not filled
	- A close below the runaway gap is a negative sign in an uptrend
	- Also called a *measuring gap* because it occurs around the halfway point of a trend
- **Exhaustion Gap** - Appears when prices leap forward in a ‘last gasp’ near the end of a market move.  This can be expected after the other 2 types of gaps have been identified.  This upward leap quickly fades and prices turn lower within a couple days/weeks
- **Island Reversal Pattern** - After an exhaustion gap has formed, prices will trade in a narrow range for awhile before gapping to the downside.  This time period leaves the prices looking like an ‘island’.  The breakaway gap to the upside followed by a breakaway gap to the downside completes the pattern and usually indicates a trend reversal pg. 97**
