Liquidity refers to the ease with which a user can purchase or sell an asset without significantly impacting its prevailing market value and is a crucial factor for traders who wish to carry out fast transactions at low volatility. Regular market forces dictate that the more liquid an asset is, the easier it is for it to be exchanged without impinging on its value.
